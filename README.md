## Project Overview
The Traffic Analysis project aims to detect and classify objects in traffic scenes using YOLOv8n. Additionally, it estimates the distance between the camera and specific objects, providing valuable insights for various applications.

## How It Works
The project leverages the YOLOv8n algorithm to identify objects in real-time traffic images or video streams. After detecting objects, it computes their distances using computer vision techniques.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Download the pre-trained YOLOv8n weights and place them in the designated directory.
4. Run the object detection script, providing the input source (image or video) as an argument.

## Frontend (React)
- Describe how to set up the React frontend.
- Include any relevant instructions for running the frontend.

## Backend (Flask)
- Describe how to set up the Flask backend.
- Include any relevant instructions for running the backend.
